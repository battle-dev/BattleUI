# BattleUI

This addon is designed specifically for use in WoW Classic TBC. It may work in 
WoW Classic or Retail versions, but it is not specifically designed to do so.

This addon updates various parts of the World of Warcraft user interface. This
is my own personal UI mod, so it takes into consideration some of the addons
that I use for things like unit frames (EasyFrames) and damage meters
(Details). If you are using this addon and you want to use a different addon
for these parts of the UI or you don't want to use any addon at all, then you
would need to either modify parts of the addon to match your own needs.
